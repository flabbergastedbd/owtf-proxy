# This inbound proxy is being developed for OWASP OWTF
# as a part of Google Summer of Code 2013.

Inorder for this module to work, please follow these steps :-

1. Create a .owtf folder in your home directory, add a directory proxy
   and inside proxy add another directory called certs.

2. Run the following two commands in the ~/.owtf/proxy/ directory itself, to create a
   local Certificate Authority.

   Please make sure you use the password "owtf-dev" for key file

   * openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 1024
   
   * openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

3. Add the generated ca.crt to your trusted CAs in your browser

So, your directory structure will be like :-

* ~/.owtf/proxy/ca.crt
* ~/.owtf/proxy/ca.key
* ~/.owtf/proxy/certs/
